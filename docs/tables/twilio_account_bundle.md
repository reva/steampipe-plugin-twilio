# Table: twilio_account_bundle

The Regulatory Bundles are Item Assignments of End-Users and Supporting Documents for regulatory compliance.

Depending on the configuration of the bundle, the bundle is being assessed against a Regulation (e.g., Germany local phone numbers for a business). Different Regulations need Item Assignments combinations of End-User Types and Supporting Document Types.
